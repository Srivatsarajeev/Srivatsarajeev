               <p>The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as mysuru (literally, "citadel").
                Swapna built the first palace inside the Old Fort in the 14th century, which was set ablaze and reconstructed multiple times. 
                The Old Fort was built of wood and thus easily caught fire, while the current fort was built of stone, bricks and wood. 
                The current structure was constructed between 1897 and 1912, after the Old Palace burnt down, the current structure is also known as the New Fort.
                Mysore Palace is one of the most famous tourist attractions in India, after the Taj Mahal, with more than six million annual visitors.</p>

            <p>The last palace, now known as the Old Palace or the Wooden Palace, burned to ashes during the wedding of Jayalakshammani, the eldest daughter of Chamaraja Wodeyar in 1896. Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV and his mother Maharani Kempananjammanni Devi commissioned the British architect Henry Irwin to build a new palace.[2] E.W. Fritchley worked as a consulting Engineer. Meanwhile, the royal family stayed in the nearby Jaganmohan Palace. Construction was overseen by an executive engineer in the Mysore Palace division. He conducted elaborate architectural studies during his visits to Delhi, Madras, and Calcutta, and these were used to plan the new palace. The construction cost was placed at Rs 41,47,913 (around $30 million adjusted to inflation) and the palace was completed in 1912.[3][4]

                The palace was further expanded in around 1930 (including the addition of the present Public Durbar Hall wing) during the reign of Maharaja Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar.[5]</p>

           <p>The inside of the Palace is beautiful, the architecture and decor is exquisite.
            When we had finished the main Palace we went outside and found the old Palace and museum.
            We also enjoyed walking around the grounds and discovered the Palace elephants  </p>

        <p>The Mysore palace is the most conveniently located tourist attraction. 
            The sheer size, decorations, beautiful wood doors and the colorful pillars will
             amaze you so much so that you want to capture everything in the camera. 
             The place is always crowded and visiting it during late evening makes it even more special because of the spectacular 
             lighting all around the palace walls
